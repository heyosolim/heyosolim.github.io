She addresses politicians around the world with moving speeches.``I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words." This is a quote from Greta as she speaks to the politicians and government officials around the world. Greta has made a huge impact in addressing the need to do something about global warming.</p>
