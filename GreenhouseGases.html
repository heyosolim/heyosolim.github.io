<p>	Greenhouse gases are gases that affect and contribute to global warming. The biggest greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide causes something called the Greenhouse Effect. The Greenhouse Effect is when carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, traps some of the Sun's heat. The more carbon there is in the atmosphere the more heat from the Sun gets trapped. The carbon cycle also puts carbon into the atmosphere. The carbon cycle is how carbon is transferred through the environment. For example, animals and people breathe in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. Some of that carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere and some of it goes into plants. Plants "breathe" in carbon dioxide and "breathe" out oxygen. Another example is when organisms die, carbon stored inside them gets released into the atmosphere.


<p>	The biggest cause of global warming, however, is humans. We release a lot of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that affect global warming. We contribute to global warming by burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuels include coal, crude oil, and petroleum. But that's not all. We contribute to global warming by cutting down trees. When we burn or leave trees to rot, the stored carbon in them gets released into the air as carbon dioxide. Our planet already has carbon dioxide in its atmosphere which causes the Greenhouse Effect. But by doing all these things we're adding to the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which increases global warming. It's true that we can't stop global warming because many things help it that are out of our control. But what we can control is how we contribute to global warming.</p>
